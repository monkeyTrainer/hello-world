Learning about github
I've been coding as a hobby since 2005, but only proffessionally since 2015. I have decided to offer contributions to some open source projects with a view to improving my skills and to try to connect with people in the coding community. Although my strongest language is c# I have an interest in all software development, the only limit is the time I have.
